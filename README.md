# My Projects Portfolio
*This repository serves as a living portfolio of my projects*

## **My Journey:**
- While I was exposed to programming sometime in 2012, my journey didn’t really take off until around 2015. This was when I started learning ```C++``` at my state college, and Java through my high school FIRST Robotics Team. I really enjoyed all the programming I was doing, and I didn’t want to stop!

- I started teaching myself JavaScript in 2016, and to my surprise it was nothing like Java! I enjoyed the challenge of learning a new language, and this is when my passion for Game Development began. I started off by re-creating some well-know and simple games, but eventually would find myself designing games from scratch too *~~(not the language)~~*. 

- In 2017, I participated in programing competitions offered at my state college, and this is when I realized something: I **love** solving problems! The process of getting a bunch of mini-problems to solve in a small amount of time really resonated with me, and firmly solidified where I want my career to be.

- During Summer 2019, I started to push my Game Dev skills. I decided to code plugins for Minecraft Java, to no one’s surprise using Java. This was not like my past experiences with Java though, now I was working with Maven and other recourses to package my work together. Furthermore, I was using the Spigot API, and this was my first experience reading large amounts of technical documentation.

- In 2019, I started at university as a full-time student studying Computer Science *~~(AND Mechanical Engineering)~~*. It was at Uni that I worked more in-depth with C, Linux, and eventually Java again. I found a new understanding for how to write code that doesn’t just get the job done; but does so quickly, cleanly, and efficiently. I learned that computer science is just math in disguise, but I like math so I’ll take that as a win!

- Once 2020 I started exploring Game Development on the side, and began working with C# in Unity; eventually switching to Godot. This was when I decided to start developing my own games, as opposed creating clones or modifications to already existing games. While I have not produced a finished game yet *~~(Because my starting project was quite a bit ambitious)~~*, I have learned much about the Godot game engine and C#. 


## **SnakeGame:**   <img src="https://github.com/pamyjak/portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/SnakeGame.gif" width="64" height="36" />
- This is my recreation of the infamous Snake Game, as well as one of my first finished projects using JavaScript

- I developed this game over a weekend in May 2016 in hopes to build my skills in JavaScript, as well as begin my journey in Game Development

- I learned very quickly how JavaScript differed from the C++ and Java that I was familiar with, beyond just the syntax differences. Dynamic typing and just-in-time compilation were confusing at first given my background thus far, but the more I learned of the differenced behind the scenes the better my projects got
