## **SnakeGame** <img src="https://github.com/pamyjak/portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/SnakeGame.gif" width="64" height="36" />
- This is my recreation of the infamous Snake Game, as well as one of my first finished projects using JavaScript

- I developed this game over a weekend in May 2016 in hopes to build my skills in JavaScript, as well as begin my journey in Game Development

- I learned very quickly how JavaScript differed from the C++ and Java that I was familiar with, beyond just the syntax differences. Dynamic typing and just-in-time compilation were confusing at first given my background thus far, but the more I learned of the differenced behind the scenes the better my projects got
