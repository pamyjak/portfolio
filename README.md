<!-- ==================== My Journey ==================== -->
## **My Journey:**
***About Me***
- While I was exposed to programming sometime in 2012, my journey didn’t really take off until around 2015. This was when I started learning ```Java``` through my high school FIRST Robotics Team, and later ```C++``` at my state college. I really enjoyed all the programming I was doing, and I didn’t want to stop!

- I started teaching myself ```JavaScript``` in 2016, and to my surprise it was nothing like Java! I enjoyed the challenge of learning a new language, and this is when my passion for Game Development began. I started off by re-creating some well-known and simple games, but eventually would find myself designing games from scratch too *~~(not the language)~~*. 

- In 2017, I participated in programing competitions offered at my state college using ```C++```, and this is when I realized something: I ***love*** solving problems! The process of getting a bunch of mini-problems to solve in a small amount of time really resonated with me, and firmly solidified where I want my career to be.

- During Summer 2019, I started to push my Game Dev skills. I decided to code plugins for Minecraft Java, to no one’s surprise using ```Java```. This was not like my past experiences with ```Java``` though, now I was working with ```Maven``` and other recourses to package my work together. Furthermore, I was using the ```Spigot API```, and this was my first experience reading large amounts of technical documentation.

- In 2019, I started at university as a full-time student studying Computer Science *~~(AND Mechanical Engineering)~~*. It was at Uni that I worked more in-depth with ```C```, ```Linux```, and eventually ```Java``` again. I found a new understanding for how to write code that doesn’t just get the job done; but does so quickly, cleanly, and efficiently. I learned that computer science is just math in disguise, but I like math so I’ll take that as a win!

- Once 2020 I started exploring Game Development on the side, and began working with ```C#``` in ```Unity```; eventually switching to ```Godot```. This was when I decided to start developing my own games, as opposed creating clones or modifications to already existing games. While I have not produced a finished game yet *~~(Because my starting project was quite a bit ambitious)~~*, I have learned much about the ```Godot``` game engine and ```C#```. 

<!-- ==================== Snake Game ==================== -->
## **Snake Game:**
***May 2016***
- This is my recreation of the infamous Snake Game, as well as one of my first finished projects using ```JavaScript```.

- I developed this game over a weekend in May 2016 in hopes to build my skills in JavaScript, as well as begin my journey in Game Development.

- I learned very quickly how JavaScript differed from the ```C++``` and ```Java``` that I was familiar with, beyond just the syntax differences. Dynamic typing and just-in-time compilation were confusing at first given my background thus far, but the more I learned of the differenced behind the scenes the better my projects got.

<!-- ==================== 2048 Game ==================== -->
## **2048:**
***June 2016, Weekend Project***
- Snake was a fun project, and a good intro to ```JavaScript```, but I wanted something a little more challenging. I have always been a big fan of 2048, and thought this was a perfect game to re-create in ```JavaScript```.
- Developing this game forced me to calculate collisions, which was a new concept to me at the time. I had never worked with any form of Game Engine ~~yet~~, so I had to teach myself the basics, as well as code them myself in ```JavaScript```.
- This project was another fun yet challenging one. If I were to go back and work this project again, I would definitely want to implement animations. Potentially a good future weekend ```Godot``` project!

<!-- ==================== Smart Clock ==================== -->
## **Smart Clock:**
***July 2016, One Day Project***
- After becoming more familiar with ```JavaScript```, I wanted to challenge myself with a time constraint: 12 hours to make whatever I wanted. Knowing college was just a few years away, I decided to make a project inspired by my future university.
- The initial idea for this clock came from the rings of the Apple fitness tracker, and I thought that was a really interesting and futuristic user interface! I didn’t want to just copy the rings and call it a day, that’d be no fun! I decided to combine another aesthetic: steampunk; which is another personal favorite of mine.
- after an hour of going back and forth on ideas, it was decided: A futuristic steampunk-esk smart watch screen using growing rings to convey the time, and black and gold for my future university. Now all I had to do was create this wonderful idea in my head from a blank canvas. Oh, and 11 hour left!
- I started with the layout of the roman numerals, because that with the analog rings is way more steampunk than basic decimal numbers! *(Even though I added a digital clock in the center anyways, best of both worlds I guess).* I then framed out the dividing sections, added the rings, and then some finishing touches.
- In the end, I got what has to be one of my favorite fringe-projects I have ever created. This was something original, unique, and purely **me**. One day I will find a way to add this design on to the face of my smart watch, and continue this project years after it started.

<!-- ==================== Dungeon Master ==================== -->
## **Dungeon Master:**
***January 2020 to April 2020***
- It finally happened! I found myself with some extra time at Uni, and wanted to take my Indie Game Development hobby further! I started researching everything I’d need to develop games myself and started working. I would soon start testing various different resources to eventually find the combination I would use to develop my very first original game.
- But first, let me introduce the game in question: Dungeon Master. This game will be a rogue-like dungeon crawler. Players will be able to select starting rolls with various abilities, find and use various spells and artifacts along their journey, and fight their way through the darkest depths of the dungeons.
- To no one’s surprise, this was a ***very*** ambitious first project, using a bunch of tools and assets I had never used before. Even though I have not yet completed this project, I have learned more than I ever thought I could have. I learned ```C#``` to use in the ```Unity``` game engine, and eventually switched to the open-source ```Godot``` game engine. I explored how to create and implement my own music and art, which I would create using ```Aseprite``` and ```MuseScore```. I developed better project-management skills, file-path and naming conventions, and processes for scheduling/benchmarking my work. 
- So far, I have implemented tileable rooms, player movement and animations, audio busses with music and sound effects, doors with different states, transitions between rooms, event-based signal management, rudimentary attacks, dynamic lighting, and more. This is just a small portion of what I hope to achieve with this game, but for a first start this will have to do for now. 
- This remains the biggest project I have ever started. I am still nowhere near finishing this project, and maybe I never will. As much of the completionist that I am, I would be fine never finishing *this* project. It wasn’t a project I set out on to produce, publish, and license a game; this project was meant to let me learn, and I have done just that.
